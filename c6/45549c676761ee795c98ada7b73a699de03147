Type validation: checks that content is a string before processing\n\n**Added debug output in `why.py`:**\n- Shows which API/model is being used\n- Optional debug mode via `DEVMEMORY_DEBUG=1` environment variable\n\n## What This Means\n\nWhen you run `devmemory why` again, if the API returns empty content, you'll see a specific error message like:\n- `\"OpenAI API returned empty/whitespace content (finish_reason: content_filter, content length: 0)\"`\n- `\"OpenAI API returned empty/whitespace content (finish_reason: length, content length: 0)\"`\n\nThe `finish_reason` indicates why:\n- `content_filter` — safety filters blocked the response\n- `length` — response was cut off due to token limits\n- `stop` — model stopped normally (but content is empty, which is unusual)\n- Other reasons — model-specific behavior\n\n## Next Steps\n\nRun the command again:\n```bash\ndevmemory why ./devmemory/commands/why.py\n```\n\nYou should see either:\n1. A detailed error message explaining why the content is empty, or\n2. A successful explanation if the issue was transient\n\nIf you see an error with `finish_reason: content_filter`, the model's safety filters may be blocking the response. Try:\n- Using a different model (e.g., `gpt-4o-mini`)\n- Adjusting the prompt to be less likely to trigger filters\n- Checking if there's content in the memories that might trigger filters\n\nThe improved error messages should help pinpoint the cause.",

The model couldn't generate anything because the input consumed all available tokens.\n\n## Fixes Applied\n\n1. **Input truncation** (`why.py`):\n   - Limits total input to ~8000 tokens\n   - Truncates memories if they exceed available space\n   - Truncates git history if needed\n   - Preserves word boundaries when truncating\n   - Shows warnings when truncation occurs\n\n2. **API parameter fix** (`llm_client.py`):\n   - Uses `max_output_tokens` for GPT-5 models (instead of `max_completion_tokens`)\n   - Uses `max_completion_tokens` for o3/o4 reasoning models\n   - Falls back to `max_tokens` for other models\n\n3. **Increased output limit**:\n   - Increased `max_tokens` from 1500 to 2000 to allow longer explanations\n\n4. **Better error messages**:\n   - Shows which memories/git history were truncated\n   - Provides context about why truncation happened\n\n## What This Means\n\nWhen you run `devmemory why` again:\n- The input will be automatically truncated if it's too long\n- You'll see warnings if truncation occurs\n- The model should have enough room to generate an explanation\n- GPT-5 models will use the correct API parameter\n\nThe command should now work even with many memories or long git history.

The later fix makes this fallback automatic when the LLM returns an empty explanation. Trade-off: raw is less    │\n│     synthesized but more deterministic.                                                                                             │\n│   • Robust LLM client behavior: Normalizing model responses to \"\" reduces panic/None-handling across callers. This prevents silent  │\n│     skips where the code only checked truthiness.                                                                                   │\n│   • Query and limits: The command builds a focused query (file + optional function) and accepts a limit (default 15) to constrain   │\n│     how many memories are sent to the LLM — balancing relevance vs token/cost.                                                      │\n│   • Formatting & UX: Uses Rich for panels/tables to make output readable when synthesis succeeds and to show sources clearly when   │\n│     it doesn’t.                                                                                                                     │\n│   • Potential gotcha avoided: The fallback is implemented as a re-invocation of run_why with raw=True and an immediate return;      │\n│     that avoids infinite recursion. Tests cover this behavior (tests/test_why.py includes a test named                              │\n│     test_run_why_raw_shows_git_history_when_search_fails).                                                                          │\n│   • Remaining risk: The narrative still depends on the quality and coverage of stored memories and commit messages. If memories     │\n│     are sparse, synthesized explanations will be limited — the code will now explicitly say when it lacks evidence.                 │\n│                                                                                                                                     │\n│  Relevant commits and references                                                                                                    │\n│                                                                                                                                     │\n│   • Initial feature: 2e8e56ea1f6e — feat: add devmemory why command for code archaeology (co‑authored by Cursor; large              │\n│     AI-generated content)                                                                                                           │\n│   • Robustness/fallback: b0f62f19962d — feat: add fallback for raw git memories for the given why command (author: Shahriyar        │\n│     Rzayev; generated by cursor/default)                                                                                            │\n│                                                                                                                                     │\n│  If you want, I can:                                                                                                                │\n│                                                                                                                                     │\n│   • Show the small snippet added for the fallback and where it sits in run_why.                                                     │\n│   • Summarize the tests that cover the failure and fallback scenarios.                                                              │\n│                                                                                                                                     │\n╰─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯\n\nSources (15 memories used)\n\n #    Score    Type        Topics                                           \n 1    0.304    episodic    commands, python                                 \n 2    0.318    episodic    commands, python                                 \n 3    0.320    episodic    devmemory, python                                \n 4    0.358    semantic    devmemory, code-change, tests, feature, commands \n 5    0.362    semantic    prompt, code-change                              \n 6    0.370    episodic    python, tests                                    \n 7    0.390    episodic    documentation                                    \n 8    0.417    semantic    prompt, code-change, commands, feature, core     \n 9    0.422    episodic    core, python                                     \n 10   0.425    episodic    commands, python                                 \n 11   0.432    episodic    commands, python                                 \n 12   0.434    episodic    commands, python                                 \n 13   0.442    episodic    devmemory, python                                \n 14   0.442    episodic    devmemory, python                                \n 15   0.443    episodic    commands, python",
